# Bread Mate

*Bake by Numbers*

A calculator app that helps bakers

## TODOs

~~**Baker's percentage calculator** - the bread baker's holy grail. Input flour weight, get all other ingredients as percentages or vice versa~~

~~**Hydration calculator** - water/flour ratio, shows if dough will be sticky/stiff~~

~~**Desired dough weight** → ingredients - "I want 800g of dough" → breaks down flour, water, salt, yeast~~

~~**Recipe scaler** - scale any recipe up/down by portions or total weight~~

Really handy:

~~**Water temperature calculator** - factors in flour temp, room temp, friction factor to hit target dough temp~~

~~**Autolyse timer** - just a simple reminder, but bakers forget~~

~~**Bulk fermentation time adjuster** - warmer room = shorter time~~

Nice-to-haves:

**Sourdough feeding calculator** - starter ratios

**Flour substitution ratios** - swapping whole wheat for AP flour (affects hydration)

**Oven spring estimator** - how much will dough rise in oven

**Unit conversions** - cups to grams? Necessary?

## Resources

As an amateur baker, I like good resources on bread baking. So, I'll be listing all resources I'm using here. Most will be books, as I prefer that medium when baking bread and researching topics.
